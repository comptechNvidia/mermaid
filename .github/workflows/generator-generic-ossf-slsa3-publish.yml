# This workflow generates an SLSA provenance file for your project.
# It satisfies level 3 for provenance requirements as per the SLSA specifications.
# The project is an initiative of the OpenSSF (openssf.org) and is developed at
# https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator.
# For more information on SLSA and how it enhances software supply chain security, visit slsa.dev.
